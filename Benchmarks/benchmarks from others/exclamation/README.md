Welcome to Exclamation benchmark

this benchmark calculates 11! (fact(11))

the aim of this is to test multiply functionality and also branch predictor's functionality

To use this benchmark, you can compare the exclamation_reg_out file with yours after running simulation with exclamation_mem_in and default regs_in. 

If it cost you about 50 cycles to run this benchmark, it means your branch predictor is in a decent condition.

the answer of 11! is contained in the register2
