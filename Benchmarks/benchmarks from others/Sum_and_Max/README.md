Welcome to Sum and Max benchmark

this benchmark loads 30 numbers from memory, calculates their sum and finds the max number among them

the aim of this is to test whether CPU can correctly stop.

To use this benchmark, you can compare the sum_and_max_reg_out file with yours after running simulation with sum_and_max_mem_in and default regs_in. 

if you find that the max value(stored in register5) is wrong, that may means your CPU didn't stop correctly.

the sum of numbers is stored in the register3.
