Welcome to Control attack benchmark

this benchmark contains a gruop of branches which are Take NotTaken T NT etc. 

the aim of this is to test branch functionality and also branch predictor's functionality

To use this benchmark, you can compare the control_attack_reg_out file with yours after running simulation with control_attack_mem_in and default regs_in.

if you find out that it cost you around 12 cycles to go through this benchmark it means that your branch predictor is excellent and do all prediction correctly.
